            <h3>About Sojib Das</h3>
            <p class="pr">
                My name is SOJiB DAS I’m a dreamer, I’m a believer and I’m a doer. I am well known for my presentation
                skill. I
                can speak very well both in Bengali and English. Another quality of me that I feel proud of is – I’m a
                quick
                learner and self-motivated person. I have learned to using computer by myself without anyone’s help.
                It’s a
                tough job for most people.I was born and brought up in Dewkhola,Fulbaria, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. I’ve
                spend
                my
                childhood in the midst of greenery, in a remote village. . My father is a tailor worked and my mother
                does
                what
                she loves the most, she takes care of us.I am frank and pretty friendly. Some say I’m introvert but when
                it
                comes to public speaking, I sure talk! I have my only weakness which is, I can’t say No to people. I
                find it
                difficult to refuse people specially when it’s about helping them.
